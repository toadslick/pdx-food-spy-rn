While in active development, only iOS is being supported on this project.
Changes required to also support Android:

- update manifest/build files to support geolocation
- constrain layout to portrait-only for android

General todo and improvements:

- fork react-native-geocoder to support a searchable region
  - update SearchByAddress to use region instead of appending city/state to query
