While in active development, only iOS is being supported on this project.
Changes required to also support Android:

- install react-navigation android
- install react-native-geocoder android
- replace ios-only SegmentControl in components/screens/home
- replace ios-only ActionSheet in components/screens/search-results-list
- update project XML to support geolocation
- constrain layout to portrait-only for android



General todo and improvements:

- fork react-native-geocoder to support a searchable region
  - update SearchByAddress to use region instead of appending city/state to query



Pain points compared to native iOS code:

- navigation
  - difficult to reference components in one navigator from screens in another navigator
    - for example, referencing the header bar button of a stack navigator,
      from a screen in a tab navigator that is a child of the stack navigator

- list view
  - tapped table rows do not stay selected
  - must manually track which table row is selected or deselected

- map view
  - no access to grouping of markers
  - no access to markers with text content
  - view inside callout does not sit flush with edges of callout bubble
    - styling a tapped or selected callout is limited unless rendering a fully custom callout view
      - this loses the "speech bubble point" and masking of the default iOS callout
